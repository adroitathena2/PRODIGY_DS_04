# PRODIGY_DS_Task1
Problem Statement: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

This project is designed to analyze social media data, focusing on sentiment patterns and message characteristics in a training dataset and a validation dataset. The analysis aims to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or entities. Below is a breakdown of the various steps and analyses carried out in this project:

1. Installing and importing libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
2. Data Loading from CSV files:
     Training Data: Data used to build models and perform initial analyses.
     Validation Data: Data used to validate the outcomes and verify consistency.
3. Initial Inspection to get overview of data using .head()
4. Check for missing values and duplicates
5. Data Cleaning (removing duplicate tweets)
6. Data Visualization

Conclusion:
These analyses and visualizations help to understand sentiment patterns, entity distribution, and message characteristics in social media data.
